# Learning @Turing College
> Hey! I am one of the lucky ones studying Data Science part time at Turing College. This is one of the exercises we are doing, so if you're interested in my ability to write a class, a test or add a docstring, please check files tesla.py and test_tesla.py. It is not much, but that were the requirements. So let the less be more this time.
